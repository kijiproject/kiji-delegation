/**
 * A lightweight service loading library based on java.util.ServiceLoader that
 * can be used by Kiji framework modules for dynamically loading different
 * service provider implementations at runtime. This delegates functionality
 * required by "upstream" modules to downstream runtime implementations.
 *
 * <p>The main client class is {@link org.kiji.delegation.Lookup Lookup},
 * which provides an API for lookups, as well as factory methods for
 * lookup service implementations.</p>
 *
 * <p>Clients cannot instantiate a <tt>Lookup</tt> object directly. Instead, use the
 * {@link org.kiji.delegation.Lookups Lookups} factory class.</p>
 *
 * <p>Several more specialized forms of <tt>Lookup</tt> can be used in conjunction
 * with associated "provider" APIs. For instance, {@link org.kiji.delegation.PriorityLookup
 * PriorityLookup} allows the client to choose an implementation based on its relative
 * priority to other implementations; these must implement {@link
 * org.kiji.delegation.PriorityProvider PriorityProvider}.</p>
